      <p>Hi üëã</p>

      <p>
        My name is Alexey, I‚Äôm a software developer, mainly focusing on frontend
        web development.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many software libraries out there and choosing the ‚Äúright‚Äù one
        was always a challenge for me. Searching the Internet, gathering the
        necessary information and comparing libraries was a tedious and
        time-consuming task.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is why I decided to build Moiva: to collect data for all key
        metrics in one place and present them in a meaningful way to make
        library evaluation and comparison as simple as possible. As an added
        bonus, Moiva provides alternatives to consider.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moiva‚Äôs current objective is to cover Npm packages ecosystem. The
        long-term plan is to cover other languages such as Php, Go, and Java.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you like the project, consider sharing it and spreading the word
        about it.
